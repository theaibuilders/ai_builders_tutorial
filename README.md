## What You'll Learn

Each tutorial is designed to be practical and immediately applicable:

‚Ä¢ **Concise and To-the-point**: We cover the most important concepts of each tool for you to get started quickly
‚Ä¢ **Hands-on Examples**: Every concept includes working code you can run and modify
‚Ä¢ **Best Practices**: Learn industry-standard approaches and common pitfalls to avoid
‚Ä¢ **Progressive Complexity**: Start with basics and advance to sophisticated implementations

Tutorials are written in Python or TypeScript with concise explanations and runnable code / notebooks. Many include copy‚Äëfriendly prompts and refactor patterns so you can adapt them directly into real projects.



## Tutorial Categories

Below is a quick mental map of the content areas. Open a category in the sidebar to explore individual tools, frameworks, and notebooks.

### Vibe Coding
Leverage AI‚Äënative editors (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) plus one‚Äëclick deploy flows to supercharge iteration beyond simple ‚Äúchat‚Äù usage‚Äîown your code, not just generated files.

### Automation
Connect AI + workflow engines (n8n, Zapier‚Äëstyle orchestration, background jobs) to trigger agents or model calls from events and pipelines.

### Model Providers
Call, configure, and optimize a wide range of proprietary & open model APIs (latency, quality, fallbacks, cost shaping).

### Gateways
Unify multiple providers behind one interface with routing, retries, caching, usage tracking, and graceful degradation.

### Frameworks
End‚Äëto‚Äëend application scaffolds: retrieval augmentation, tool‚Äëcalling agents, multi‚Äëstep orchestration, structured outputs, evaluation harnesses.

### Chat UI Framework
Rapidly build production‚Äëready conversational & multimodal interfaces with state management, streaming, and tool feedback loops.

### Observability
Instrument, trace, evaluate, and debug LLM/agent behavior in staging & prod; collect spans, prompts, scores, and regression signals.

### Fine Tuning
Adapt base models to domain style or task specifics; cover dataset prep, parameter‚Äëefficient methods, evaluation & iteration.

### Data & Memory
Embed, store, and retrieve context using vector databases, hybrid search, chunking strategies, and long‚Äëhorizon memory patterns.

### Web Search
Integrate live search, crawling, proxy rotation, and SERP/structured extraction to ground responses in current information.

### Browser Use
Empower agents to navigate, extract, and act within live web contexts (headless & interactive) for research, QA, and scripted tasks.

### Audio / Realtime
Low‚Äëlatency speech recognition, streaming synthesis, and realtime bidirectional agent experiences.

### Image & Video
Generate & manipulate visual media (diffusion, video pipelines, asset optimization, multimodal grounding).
