# LiveKit Agents: Build Voice AI Agents from Scratch

Welcome to this tutorial on **LiveKit Agents**! We'll walk you through building your first AI-powered voice agent, covering the essential concepts and advanced features to get you started and productive with LiveKit. This version uses a modular code structure for clarity and extensibility.

## 1. Introduction to LiveKit Agents

**LiveKit Agents** is a powerful framework for building **real-time, multimodal AI agents**. These agents can interact with users through voice, video, and text, making them perfect for applications like customer support bots, interactive games, and more.

At its core, a LiveKit Agent is a stateful, long-running process that connects to the LiveKit network using **WebRTC**. This allows for the low-latency communication that's crucial for creating natural and engaging user experiences.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

  * **Python 3.9+** installed on your system.
  * A **LiveKit Cloud account**. You can sign up for free at [cloud.livekit.io](https://cloud.livekit.io).
  * **API keys** for the services you'll use. For this tutorial, we'll use OpenAI.
  * The **LiveKit CLI** installed. You can install it with `brew install livekit-cli` on macOS, `winget install LiveKit.LiveKitCLI` on Windows, or `curl -sSL https://get.livekit.io/cli | bash` on Linux.

## 3. Setup

Let's get your project environment set up.

### Create a Project Directory

First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

```bash
mkdir livekit-agent-tutorial
cd livekit-agent-tutorial
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies. Create and activate one now.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Next, install the necessary Python libraries.

```bash
pip install livekit-agents "livekit-plugins-openai" python-dotenv requests
```

### Configure Your Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in your project directory. This file will securely store and load your credentials. You can find your LiveKit credentials in your LiveKit Cloud project settings.

```
# .env
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://YOUR_PROJECT_URL.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=YOUR_AGENT_API_KEY
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=YOUR_AGENT_API_SECRET
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
# Optional defaults
# OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17
# DEFAULT_WEATHER_CITY=London
```

> **Note:** Make sure to use an **Agent** API key/secret from your LiveKit Cloud dashboard, not an Admin key.

## 4. Modular Project Structure

To keep your codebase clean and extensible, we'll split advanced features into separate files:

- `agent.py`: Main orchestration and agent logic.
- `tools.py`: Functions the agent can call (e.g., get_time, get_weather).
- `memory.py`: User context/memory management.
- `logging_config.py`: Advanced logging setup.
- `events.py`: Custom event handling (e.g., user join/leave).

This modular approach makes it easy to add new features and keep your code organized.

## 5. Implementing the Modules

TOOLS = {
    "get_time": get_current_time,
    "get_weather": get_weather,
}
```

**How to extend:** Add more functions to `tools.py` and register them in the `TOOLS` dictionary. The agent can then call them by name.

### memory.py

```python
class UserMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self._store = {}

    def set(self, user_id, key, value):
        if user_id not in self._store:
            self._store[user_id] = {}
        self._store[user_id][key] = value

    def get(self, user_id, key, default=None):
        return self._store.get(user_id, {}).get(key, default)

    def clear(self, user_id):
        if user_id in self._store:
            del self._store[user_id]
```

**How to extend:** Store more user attributes (preferences, history, etc.) for personalized conversations.

### logging_config.py

```python
import logging
import os

def setup_logging(log_file="agent.log", level=logging.INFO):
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(level)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s %(name)s: %(message)s')

    # Console handler
    ch = logging.StreamHandler()
    ch.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(ch)

    # File handler
    fh = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
    fh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(fh)

    return logger
```

**How to extend:** Adjust log level, log to different files, or add more handlers as needed.

### events.py

```python
def on_user_join(user_id, context):
    # Custom logic for when a user joins the room
    print(f"User {user_id} joined the room.")


def on_user_leave(user_id, context):
    # Custom logic for when a user leaves the room
    print(f"User {user_id} left the room.")
```

**How to extend:** Add more event handlers for room events, user actions, etc.

## 6. Running the Agent

To run your agent, execute the following command in your terminal. This will start the agent, making it ready to accept connections.

```bash
python agent.py start
```

To test your agent, use the **LiveKit Agents Playground** at [agents-playground.livekit.io](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/). Connect the playground to your LiveKit project, and you can start talking with your new agent in real-time!

## 7. Debugging Common Issues

- **401 Unauthorized:** Make sure you are using an **Agent** API key/secret, not an Admin key. Double-check your `.env` file and LiveKit Cloud dashboard.
- **Connection Refused:** Ensure your `LIVEKIT_URL` is correct and your project is active.
- **No Audio/No Response:** Check your OpenAI API key and ensure your agent is running and connected.
- **Tool not called:** Ensure your functions are decorated with `@function_tool` in `agent.py`. The SDK auto-discovers these on the `Agent` instance.

## 8. Next Steps and Advanced Concepts

Congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully built and run an advanced, modular **LiveKit Agent**.

From here, you can explore:

  * **Different plugins:** Try out other STT, LLM, and TTS providers.
  * **Function calling:** Enable your agent to interact with external APIs and tools.
  * **Multimodal agents:** Build agents that can understand and generate video as well as audio.
  * **Context and memory:** Store and use user context for more personalized conversations.
  * **Custom event handling:** Respond to room events, user join/leave, etc.
  * **Production deployment:** Use Docker, cloud hosting, and monitoring for robust deployments.
