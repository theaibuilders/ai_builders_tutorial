    "# Context Engineering: A Hands-on Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on **Context Engineering**! In the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), you've probably heard of Prompt Engineering. While prompt engineering is about crafting the perfect question, context engineering is about providing the LLM with the right *information* to answer that question. It's the art and science of designing systems that feed LLMs the relevant context they need to perform a task effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: if you ask a historian a question, they'll give you a much better answer if they have their library of books and research papers handy. Context engineering is about building that library for your LLM and making sure it can find the right book at the right time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Context Engineering Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs have a limited \"memory\" called the **context window**. They can only consider a certain amount of information at a time. Context engineering helps us make the most of this limited space by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improving Accuracy:** By providing relevant, factual information, we can reduce the chances of the LLM \"hallucinating\" or making things up.\n",
    "* **Enhancing Relevance:** We can steer the LLM's responses to be more specific and tailored to the user's needs.\n",
    "* **Enabling Complex Tasks:** For tasks that require knowledge of specific documents or conversations, context engineering is essential. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context-Problem Fit (CPF)\n",
    "A core idea you'll rely on throughout this notebook is achieving strong **Context-Problem Fit (CPF)**. CPF means the context you assemble (retrieved documents, system instructions, tool schemas, memory, artifacts, etc.) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Necessary** — each piece directly supports solving the current task.\n",
    "2. **Sufficient** — taken together, the context eliminates major ambiguity and minimizes guesswork.\n",
    "3. **Efficient** — it fits within token limits without bloating the prompt with redundant or low-signal content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great agents fail more often from poor CPF than from weak model capability. Always ask: *Does this context chunk increase the probability of a correct, useful answer for this specific problem?* If not, refine retrieval, compress, filter, or enrich.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the basics of context engineering, from a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to System Prompts, Tool Schemas, and Message Buffer, and Files & Artifacts etc. Let's get started! 🚀"
