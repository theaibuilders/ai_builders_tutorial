## Additional Configurations for Your n8n Instance

You can also configure your n8n instance further with the following options:

1.  In your Zeabur dashboard, navigate to your n8n project.
2.  Go to the **Networking** tab.
3.  Add your own custom domain.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

To keep your API keys and other secrets secure, use environment variables.

1.  In your Zeabur project, go to the **Variables** tab.
2.  Add your environment variables. For example, to add an OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
Now you can access these variables in your n8n workflows using an expression: `{{ $env.OPENAI_API_KEY }}`.

## Get Your FREE Credits ðŸ’°

You can claim **FREE $5 USD Zeabur credits** through the AI Builders community (enough to cover a basic n8n instance for about a month):

1. Visit the AI Builders Zeabur perk page: [https://theaibuilders.dev/zeabur](https://theaibuilders.dev/zeabur).
2. Follow the instructions (join the community if you haven't already & submit the short form).
3. Receive your credit code / automatic credit application from Zeabur (processing can take a short whileâ€”check your email or Zeabur billing dashboard).

> Tip: Apply the credit before scaling up resources so you maximize the free usage window.
